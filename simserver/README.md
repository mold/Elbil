the jar is here
===============

then you start it with java >=1.6.0 like

```java -jar STNSimulator.jar```

there has to be a directory logs/ in the running folder. you can download the logs from the box, or one by one from http://ev.csc.kth.se/cristi/stn_simulator/logs/<name_of_log>

in the unix account at CSC, you do like

```module add jdk/1.6.0```

the simulator listens to port 3000 as it does on ev.csc.kth.se
